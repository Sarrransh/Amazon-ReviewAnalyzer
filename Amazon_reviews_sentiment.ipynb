Installation went super smooth. The installation guys came within the same day. The installation process started, and it was done in 3 hours max.Also, for those people who are saying that they are charging money even when installation is free, you guys have no idea about how AC installation is done.The extra charges can vary heavily depending on the amount of material needed including pipe, tape and so on. In my case, it cost me 5000INR, and I am super happy with it.The build quality of the AC is excellent. The internal unit looks sleek and modern. The AC functions as advertised. It  cools very nicely.Overall ValueThe overall value of the AC is just excellent. It is affordable and enables you to enjoy with minimal electricity bills.'"
